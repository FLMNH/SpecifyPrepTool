C # .NET project to allow for bulk preparation creation.
# About
The Specify Prep Tool is .NET graphical desktop application written in C#. The application consumes an .xls file containing either the CollectionObject.GUID or CollectionObject.catalogNumber and adds a preparation to the Collection Object corresponding to each row of the spreadsheet.  The user further has the ability to select which Agent the change is attributed to.  Finally, the application reports how many preparations were successfully inserted, appends the newly created preparation GUIDs to the uploaded spreadsheet and allows the user to download the amended spreadsheet.
